# Where is Rust used these days?

Rust is a relatively young language, and as a result it has comparatively lower adoption in the industry as compared to other languages. Moreover, since other more popular languages have the luxury of time, people have also been making software that have proved to be important and popular in those languages. Hopefully this list demonstrates some of the cool software people have written in Rust, helps illustrate why Rust is here to stay and how Rust can help you build fast and safe software while simultaneously being a joy to write.

Take note that this list is not exhaustive and I might have failed to add any obvious projects to the list. Feel free to file an issue if I have missed something.

## Why not some other lists out there like [Awesome Rust](https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust)?

Awesome Rust is a great resource for someone learning Rust, but this list places more emphasis on software projects people outside of the Rust community may have learned or heard about, and less on libraries that are deeply ingrained into the Rust ecosystem that has made all these projects possible.
